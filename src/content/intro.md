<!-- Much of traditional decision-making science is grounded in the mathematical formulations and analyses of structured systems to recommend decisions that are optimized, robust, and uncertainty-aware. This scientific approach, rooted in the field of **Operations Research (OR)**, has evolved through decades of advancements in stochastic modeling, computational simulation, and optimization. A key strength of the OR approach is its model-based orientation, which facilitates methodological rigor, explicit uncertainty encoding, and interpretability, making it a natural engineering approach for reliable decision-making. On the other hand, recent advances in the AI/ML space have eschewed the model-based paradigm and increasingly embraced, to great success, model-free algorithmic design frameworks. In essence, the model-based rigor and assumptions of traditional OR are not yet designed to take full advantage of massive data and rapid computational advances in AI/ML. 

This workshop, which is the first NeurIPS workshop explicitly themed and structured on ML-OR synergization, aspires to present recent developments, discuss challenges, and publicize emerging research opportunities at the ML-OR intersection. By integrating ML into established OR methodologies, we have the opportunity to produce more data-centric and adaptive solutions for complex decision-making tasks that could propel, in a much faster-paced manner, the frontier of “optimality” across many relevant applications. Concomitantly, the goal is also to explore how model-based principled OR approaches can help alleviate issues revolving around “black box” systems, and provide paths to enhance interpretability, trust, and performance analysis.  

The following provides four examples of sub-topics that are of high interest to the workshop. Other topics broadly in the ML-OR intersection are greatly welcome as well.

*Embedding OR modeling insights into ML*: The rich problem domains conventionally tackled by OR, such as queueing control, supply chain and revenue management, present challenges in high dimensionality, variability and stability that are often addressed via structural models and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances have shown practical benefits in OR-embedded ML techniques, including differentiable simulators and domain-informed policy parameterizations. To this end, imminent questions include the design of generic frameworks to integrate operational domain knowledge into ML algorithms, the balance between model-based insights and data-driven flexibility, validation and stress-testing of hybrid OR+ML policies, and the use of digital twins for operational data that combine AI and OR simulation.

*Uncertainty mitigation at the interface of data, model, and decisio*n: An important challenge in converting data into reliable decisions lies in the dissection and mitigation of errors, not only arising from data prediction, but also their interactions with the system and propagation into operational decisions. These issues can be complicated by computational and modeling limitations for complex models, optimistic bias, and stochastic behaviors in decision optimization, and non-stationarity and distribution shifts. Key questions to explore here include uncertainty quantification techniques that are mindful of model computation overhead, approaches to assess performance of prescriptive decisions, and hedging of downside risks from data noises and shifts via robustification or goal-driven regularization. 

*Sequential decision-making and online learning from an OR perspective*: Many modern data-driven operations are intrinsically sequential, namely, the system state evolves after every action, fresh information arrives online, and decisions adapt in real time. Despite sustained efforts on theoretical research, key questions remain in achieving balance among statistical efficiency, robustness, and practical implementability, especially when facing non-stationarity, risk-sensitive, and multi-objective criteria that appear in many operational settings. This presents opportunities to leverage the analytic arsenal of OR, including stochastic processes, convex and non-convex optimization, optimal control, and distributionally robust techniques, that can play pivotal roles in tightening theoretical bounds, guiding exploration, and yielding computationally tractable policies.

*Generative AI for decision-making*: Generative AI has recently emerged as a transformative technology that, based on sampling and statistical modeling power, offers enhanced decision-making capabilities across multiple domains. At the same time, some of the cores in generative modeling are rooted in Monte Carlo simulation methodology and stochastic analysis, which have a rich literature in OR. Key questions to explore here include the efficient utilization of generative models to capture uncertainties in complex operational problems, how to build generative frameworks to recognize guarantees on robustness or safety needed for decision-making, and how to tackle these issues via the vast theoretical and computational literature on stochastic analysis, including diffusion and flow-based models.

This interdisciplinary workshop explores the growing synergy between **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Operations Research (OR)**. As the first NeurIPS workshop explicitly themed on ML-OR synergization, it aims to present recent developments, discuss challenges, and publicize emerging research opportunities in data-centric decision-making that leverage both the rapid advancement of ML and the principled methodological rigor of OR. We welcome a broad range of contributions in the ML-OR intersection.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Embedding OR modeling insights into ML
- Uncertainty mitigation at the interface of data, model, and decision 
- Sequential decision-making and online learning from an OR perspective
- Generative AI for decision-making

We encourage submissions and participation from researchers across ML, OR, applied probability, and statistics, as well as practitioners from industry and public sector organizations. We especially encourage submissions that propose new methodologies, offer theoretical insights, or present real-world applications in areas such as healthcare, logistics, finance, and energy systems.

In addition to the poster session and presentation of accepted submissions, the workshop will feature several keynote talks, panel discussions, and plenty of opportunities to interact among participants.

We also plan to provide financial support for students and junior researchers who contribute to the workshop, via INFORMS Applied Probability Society and potentially other sponsors. More details on the application procedure will be available soon.
