Submissions are limited to at most 4 pages of main body, in the NeurIPS conference proceedings format (please see [<u>https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers</u>](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers)). In addition to these 4 pages, references of an unlimited length are allowed. 

Submissions are **non-anonymous** and **non-archival**. We welcome submissions based on preliminary working progress, work under review, or work that has already been published in prior venues. In particular, papers based on work under review or prior publication are allowed and encouraged.

For papers based on preliminary working progress, submission to the workshop will not preclude future journal or conference publication. Moreover, these papers will have the option to be considered for fast-track submission of the full-length version to Stochastic Systems, the flagship journal of INFORMS Applied Probability Society.

All accepted papers will be presented in an elaborate poster session at the workshop. In addition, several selected papers will be chosen as "spotlight" for oral presentations. 

Submissions should be made via OpenReview:<br>

<!-- We invite the submission of research papers and position papers on the topic of programmatic representations for agent learning. This workshop aims to explore the use of program-like structures to represent policies, reward functions, tasks, and environment models.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* **Programs as Policies:** Representing decision-making logic through programmatic policies in Python or domain-specific languages.
* **Programs as Reward Functions:** Synthesizing reward function codes for agent learning.
* **Programs as Skill Libraries:** Representing acquired skills as programs, allowing for reusing and composing skills.
* **Programmatically Generating Tasks:** Producing codes that describe diverse task variants.
* **Programs as Environment Models:** Inferring executable codes to simulate environment dynamics.

**Submission Types:**

* **Full Papers:** Up to 9 pages in ICML or NeurIPS format, with potentially large-scale experiments.
* **Short Papers:** 2-4 pages in ICML or NeurIPS format, with proof-of-concept demonstrations (demos, code, blog posts).

**Important Dates:**

* Submission Deadline: ~~May 24, 2025, AoE~~ May 30, 2025, AoE
* Author Notification: ~~June 7, 2025, AoE~~ June 13, 2025, AoE
* Camera Ready Deadline: July 7, 2025, AoE
* Workshop Date: July 18, 2025 -->

<!-- Accepted papers will be presented during poster sessions, with exceptional submissions selected for spotlight oral presentations.

All accepted papers will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing for future submissions to archival conferences or journals.
